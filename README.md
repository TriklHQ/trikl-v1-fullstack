# Trikl-V1 Code

Trikl is like on-chain Patreon and growing continuously to become more. We solve the above-mentioned issues with a transparent, on-chain, secure platform that helps influencers create a strong monetizable community, curates the best recommendations, and allows users to be a part of exclusive communities.
